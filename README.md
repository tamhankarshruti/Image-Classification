# Image-Classification

This project develops a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify fruits and vegetables. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, and the model is trained with convolutional and pooling layers. Predictions are made using softmax, ensuring accurate classification. Finally, the model is deployed on Streamlit, enabling users to upload images and explore predictions interactively.
